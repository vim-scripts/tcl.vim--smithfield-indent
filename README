This is a replacement for the tcl indent file that ships with vim. 

Handles line continuations, nested braces and combination of the two. Skips over braces in comments. This should produce indented code that looks "as you'd expect".

If you have any suggestions or bugs, please send them along. 

Requires vimscript #1603.
